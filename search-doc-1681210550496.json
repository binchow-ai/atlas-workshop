"},{"title":"Indexing Basics","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/atlas-workshop/docs/indexing-basics/","content":"Indexing Basics In any database, indexes support the efficient execution of queries. Without them, the database must scan every document in a collection or table to select those that match the query statement. If an appropriate index exists for a query, the database can use the index to limit the number of documents it must inspect. MongoDB offers a broad range of index types and features with language-specific sort orders to support complex access patterns to your data. MongoDB indexes can be created and dropped on-demand to accommodate evolving application requirements and query patterns and can be declared on any field within your documents, including fields nested within arrays. The order of a compound index in MongoDB has a best practices rule called ESR. This rule stands for Equality, Sort and Range field placement in the index definition. Let's create some indexes for our query. Data ExplorerCompassMongoDB Shell Data explorer allows us to create an index by going to the collection &quot;Indexes&quot; tab and creating a new index. Add the fields in the following order to try and cover our query predicts: { &quot;cast&quot; :1, &quot;year&quot; : 1, &quot;title&quot; : 1 } Now lets see the explain plans post index creation CompassMongoDB Shell The query now is using an index to minimize the amount of scanned documents, however, the query is still doing an in-memory sort Lets change the order of the fields to reflect the Equality, Sort and Range order: CompassMongoDB Shell To follow the ESR rule lets use the order according to our query cast - Equality, title- Sort and last year - Range: { &quot;cast&quot; :1, &quot;title&quot; : 1, &quot;year&quot; : 1 } And drop the previous index. As you can see only an index is used and no sort stage is present.","keywords":""},{"title":"Access your cluster","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/atlas-workshop/docs/access-your-cluster/access-the-atlas-cluster","content":"Access your cluster 1.

Edit/Add Documents​ Please see the following documentation on how to &quot;Modify&quot;, &quot;Create&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot; documents. As an excersize you can create a collection under test database named users: Insert an array of user documents in the insert document tab.
